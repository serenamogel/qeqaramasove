Made with a base of extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil, or Greek yogurt, it’ll be more nutritious than any bottled dressing you can find at the store. But that’s not all – it’ll taste better, too. Unlike most store-bought dressings, a homemade healthy salad dressing isn’t designed to keep for months on end. That means that it can be made with fresh ingredients like herbs, garlic, and avocado. They may not last for weeks…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The best party food ideas are fun. Not too fussy, not too formal.

I know I have! Soggy lettuce. Soggy bread. Zero flavor. Yeah…no thanks. But luckily for us, vegan sandwiches don’t have to be like that.

On a hot summer day, there’s nothing I crave more. Cold soup is hydrating, refreshing, and brimming with peak-season produce.
