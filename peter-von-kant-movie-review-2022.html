An early scene in Fassbinder's film where the heroine is visited by her cousin Sidonie (Katrin Schaake) is restaged so that Peter is visited by a female cousin with the same name, but she's played by <a href=#>Isabelle Adjani</a>, who wears a wig that evokes one prominently displayed in Fassbinder's movie. Amir seems to be a composite of two important men in Fassbinder's love life.&nbsp;One is El Hedi Ben Salem, a Moroccan Berber who had a tumultuous and often violent relationship with the director and acted in three of his movies, including&nbsp;"Ali:&nbsp;Fear Eats the Soul." The other is Armin Meier (note the first name, as well as&nbsp;how the full name sounds when you say both words together quickly), an orphaned ex-butcher whose relationship with Fassbinder was the partial inspiration for an episode of "Germany in Autumn."&nbsp;</p><p>That "Petra von Kant" was itself a tactically opaque&nbsp;working-through of Fassbinder's own experiences (as was, and is, the case with all dramatists to some extent) creates an ouroboros effect in the mind of the Fassbinder-conscious viewer. The project seems to devour and digest its inspiration as it unreels, possibly in attempt to return us to the place from where "Petra von Kant"&nbsp;came—though, again, who can say when the director holds his cards so close to his mid-'70s vintage, probably tan&nbsp;velour&nbsp;vest? What's deposited in viewer's laps when the final credits roll is a question mark, which is how Ozon seems to prefer it—and that's not a bad thing.&nbsp;</p><p>The actors are admirably committed—particularly&nbsp;Gharbia, who never telegraphs&nbsp;many hidden layers that Amir will ultimately reveal to us; and&nbsp;Ménochet, who captures Fassbinder's burly gossamer energy without trying to do an impersonation. He's an altogether more compelling Fassbinder-as-dramatic-construct than <a href=#>Oliver Masucci</a> in&nbsp;Oskar Röhler's&nbsp;"<a href=#>Enfant Terrible</a>" (which, like this film, also indulged armchair psychoanalysis of Fassbinder without taking the literal-minded "<a href=#>Bohemian Rhapsody</a>"-style and-then-he-did-this approach).</p><p>That almost nobody is making&nbsp;movies like this at the moment&nbsp;is a point in favor of seeking out "Peter von Kant"—although viewers should consider themselves&nbsp;forewarned that they will get more out of it if they take a lot into it, and that such a concern&nbsp;is probably the furthest thing from Ozon's mind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pnK2domLDsLqMpJinrF2ivLe1xGapnq6ZmsRufo9raQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
