Still, the way Beyoncé melds this film’s imagery in the closing number with “Spirit,” her contribution to “The Lion King”’s soundtrack, gave me a newfound appreciation for the song. It begins with Beyoncé, clad in yellow and standing in a beam of light emanating from a church window, singing the opening verse. When the camera pulls back to reveal a choir decked out in a complementary color, the image has the reverential pull of a Sunday service. The vocal harmonies coupled with the striking fashion design by Zerina Akers bring forth a visual and aural exaltation.</p><p>As its title suggests, “Black Is King” is a celebration of Black culture and Black people, where we came from, where we are, and where we are going. It’s a tribute to our ancestors, ourselves and our contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic. As a result, several songs showcase a slew of African musical collaborators like Tekno, <a href=#>Yemi Alade</a> and Mr Eazi along with American artists like Pharrell, Childish Gambino and the Carter half of the Knowles-Carter empire, Jay-Z. The music ranges from rap to gospel to a haunting lullaby delivered by Beyoncé as her character provides narrative context for the earlier, gorgeous homage to Moses that opens the film.</p><p>The stunning visuals that permeate every frame arrive courtesy of a crew of spectacular cinematographers, each of whom brings a different yet cohesive look to the set pieces. We are in the desert; by a winding river; cruising in a car through the neighborhood; in outer space and in a series of interiors, each more awesome than the last. On occasion, a familiar face fills the frame—fellow Destiny’s Child <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a>, Beyoncé’s mother, Tina, <a href=#>Naomi Campbell</a> and, in the film’s catchiest number, “Brown Skin Girl,” Lupita Nyong’o and <a href=#>Blue Ivy Carter</a>. Everyone looks fantastic, their skin radiant and their attire flowing in a tactile grace. If nothing else, “Black Is King” is a jaw-dropping visual achievement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bo5qbm2K2tHnKoqWgZZ2kw6qxjKucr6GVrHpzfJFp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
