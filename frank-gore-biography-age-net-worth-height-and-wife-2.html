It shocked to see Gore land a job in general as he ran back who has struggled to find any room to run over the last few years. His 3.77 yards per carry with the Colts over the last three years apparently spoke to the Dolphins, who are in a complete rebuild. The signing makes little sense, so don’t be surprised if the Dolphins add another running back in a talented draft class.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frank-gore-colts></span>Frank Gore Colts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s confirmed by Indianapolis Colts honchos that veteran running back Frank Gore will not return to the team in 2018.newly christened Colts coach Frank Reich confirmed to the reporters that Chris Ballard and Frank did have a discussion once the season was over.Gore’s exodus leaves Marlon Mack, Matt Jones, Robert Turbin and Josh Ferguson in the Colts’ RB shed.<br>Gore played out his three-year of $12 million deal with the Colts at a consistent clip.
