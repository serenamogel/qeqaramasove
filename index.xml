For starters, a diabetic intern is unlucky enough to fall into a snooze after making love to a nurse on a hospital bed. He is assumed to be the late occupant of that bed, and is inadvertently killed by an intravenous feeding. That is only a beginning. By the next morning, a nurse and two doctors will also be dead, mostly because they were wearing the wrong ID bracelets at the wrong time.</description></item><item><title>There Is No Cow Level In Diablo III, But There Is This</title><link>/cow-level-diablo-3.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cow-level-diablo-3.html</guid><description>Recommended Videos Obviously, there are some major Diablo III spoilers in this post, so I’m going to give you a chance to walk away from this one if you want to find this out on your own.

A schoolyard bullying incident compels Kyle’s father (Ben Reed) to give a scary dinner-table fire-and-brimstone speech to Chris and younger brother Jeff about showing would-be tough guys who’s boss (“we protect our own”); the weight of expectation seems to jam the two boys down, and in a flash-forward to the boys as young men, they’re leading the aimless lives of wannabe rodeo stars.</description></item><item><title>Indira Eskieva Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</title><link>/indira-eskieva-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-382149-html.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/indira-eskieva-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-382149-html.html</guid><description>Indira Eskieva is a columnist working for the Charlotte-based WCNC association.
