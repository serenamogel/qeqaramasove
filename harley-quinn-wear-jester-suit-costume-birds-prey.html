But it seems like those waiting to see Robbie don the classic outfit on the big screen will soon get their wish.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>According to sources close to We Got This Covered – the same ones who told us <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Woman will wear her Golden Eagle armor</a> in Patty Jenkins’ upcoming sequel, which has since been confirmed – Harley will indeed get the chance to sport her jester suit in the upcoming <strong>Birds of Prey</strong>. It’s unclear how it factors into the film, but we’ve been told it’ll only be seen on her briefly, with the character said to have “many different costumes” in the movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Margot-Robbie-Harley-Quinn-Birds-of-Prey-1.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>Still, it’ll be nice to get a rendition of Harley that pays homage to Bruce Timm’s classic series, now that her look doesn’t need to mesh with her fellow members of Task Force X and the general aesthetic of David Ayer’s film. In her next big screen effort, she’ll still be part of a team, but it’ll be a very different one that’ll see her joined by the likes of Huntress and Black Canary as they go up against <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the villainous Black Mask</a>.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Currently set to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">undergo some pretty heavy reshoots next month</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Birds of Prey&nbsp;</strong>will be with us on February 7th, 2020, and though early test screening reactions have been fairly positive, we’ll hold off on passing any judgment until we get to see a proper trailer or at least some stills.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon5qqnJrGbr3UoqWnZaearrN5yZ6qrZ2iYsC2tdNmmqirpKq6pnnBoqmdq12lv6bFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
