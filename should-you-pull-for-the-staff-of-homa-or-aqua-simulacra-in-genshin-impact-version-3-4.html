The weapons featured in the banner typically correspond to the 5-star characters featured in the Character Event Wish banner. In the first half of Version 3.4, players will be able to choose from two weapons to pull for: the Staff of Homa or the Aqua Simulacra. Which weapon is a better choice for your Primogems?</p><p data-injection=true>These weapons are joined by a 4-star collection of weapons also receiving rate-ups, meaning you’re more likely to get the following weapons when you obtain a 4-star drop: The Favonius Bow, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lithic Blade</a>, Dragon’s Bane, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Favonius Codex</a>, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a>. The Favonius Bow and Favonius Codex are solid weapons for your support characters, while the Dragon’s Bane is Hu Tao’s best 4-star weapon. The Lithic Blade and Rust are otherwise solid but not outstanding weapons, save for a few characters who utilize them well.</p><p>Note: The Weapon Event Wish banner has a pity system that allows you to select a weapon to put on an “Epitomized Path.” Whenever you pull a 5-star weapon that is not the weapon you select, you will earn a point. When you get two points, the next 5-star weapon you pull is guaranteed to be the weapon you select.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Genshin Impact promo codes and how to redeem them</a></p><h2>Should you pull for the Staff of Homa in Genshin Impact?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-28.png><p data-injection=true>The Staff of Homa is Hu Tao’s signature weapon and is a Polearm with Crit DMG as an ascension stat. This weapon is an offensive tour de force, with a passive that increases your character’s HP by 20% and another ATK bonus based on your character’s Max HP.</p><p>The Staff of Homa is one of the best Polearm weapons in the game, as it is a generally useful weapon for all DPS Polearm characters. This is Hu Tao’s best weapon, making it an obvious choice to pull for if you are a Hu Tao fan. But other characters who take advantage of this weapon are <a href=#>Xiangling</a>, <a href=#>Raiden Shogun</a>, <a href=#>Cyno</a>, and <a href=#>Xiao</a>.</p><h2>Should you pull for the Aqua Simulacra in Genshin Impact?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-29.png><p>The Aqua Simulacra is Yelan’s strongest weapon and is similar to the Staff of Homa in stats. It has a passive that increases your Max HP by 16%, but the passive is less conditional, as it always provides a flat 20% DMG buff to the equipper, whether or not they are on the field. This means <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a> can swap out and keep the DMG buff, which of course benefits her Elemental Burst.</p><p>This weapon is a little less flexible than the Staff of Homa, but the Aqua Simulacra still offers a great beacon of offensive stats. The passive also benefits off-field DPS characters, so you can use this weapon on other characters if you don’t have a Yelan, such as Fischl.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9d7bc3d022d079b0583ec3b3dbaecf49?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Joshua Chu</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Joshua Chu is a Contributing Writer at Gamepur and is known for fantastic guides on Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail.
