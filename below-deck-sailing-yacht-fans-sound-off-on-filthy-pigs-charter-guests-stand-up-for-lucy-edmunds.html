Another suggested Lucy should have left the toilet as it was for the guests to deal with themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Disgusting-guests.jpg><p>“POOR Lucy!

Lucy recalled that the situation escalated very quickly.</p><p>“It was wild. We delivered the clothes, and the throuple is like arguing. I don’t know, it was weird,” she told the outlet.</p><p>Lucy referred to the situation as “mad,” and boy, she was right. It was certainly not the way the Parsifal III crew expected to end the season, that’s for sure.</p><p>Next up for Lucy Edmunds and the rest of the crew is the Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 4 reunion. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monsters and Critics previously reported,</a> the trailer does not disappoint, with a big Colin MacRae bombshell teased.</p><p>Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 4 reunion airs Monday, July 17 at 9/8c and Tuesday,y July 18 at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5KaubDDjJ2cnKNdqK6quMinnmaxkZi1tXnFmqWsZaOkwq%2BwjKidn2Wfo3qntcutn7JloJ60tHnCoZirrJWneqjBxKyrrGWjqa6vsIyup2aen6d6rcHCsmSenJ2qu6W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
