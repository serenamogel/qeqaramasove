One of the most enjoyable parts of the CBS All Access show though, which is already renewed for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a second season</a>, has been Patrick Stewart’s chemistry with the rest of the cast, and the deep affection between Jean-Luc Picard and his friends. And the most recent episode provided a new (and very cute) nickname for Picard – “JL.”</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>The nickname comes from Raffi Musiker, Picard’s first officer on the USS Verity, the ship he took on after the USS Enterprise. Musiker refers to Picard as “JL” and is unafraid to be direct with her former commanding officer, which makes sense considering the way he’s shown to have dealt with their relationship. It turns out that the nickname was already teased in the Star Trek: Picard prequel comics series from IDW, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explores the time</a> when Picard is a Starfleet admiral and runs the Verity.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>For those not aware, Picard and Musiker are working together to rescue the Romulan people from a supernova, with Raffi chosen for her expertise in the species’ culture. Picard isn’t altogether happy with being called “JL,” but by the time they reunite 14 years later, there’s enough affection there for Musiker to still be using it. Indeed, Michelle Hurd, who plays Raffi, points to the differences between her bond with Picard and that of his former first officer Will Riker.</p><p>“It’s completely different from Riker’s, for sure, absolutely. Much more complicated, actually. And they also had a falling out, so there’s a lot of issues there and a little bit of baggage and, you know, I’m a woman. He’s not.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/star-trek-picard-04-1179661.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/star-trek-picard-03-1179660.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/star-trek-picard-02-1179658.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/star-trek-picard-01-1179657.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/star-trek-picard-05-1179656.jpeg><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Potentially intrigued by Picard’s discussion of a Romulan conspiracy within Starfleet, Musiker has joined him on his mission to find Bruce Maddox and advance the mystery of the synthetic twins at the center of this season’s storyline. As a result, we can expect to hear a lot more of the “JL” nickname going forward, and who knows, it may even spread to other characters in Picard’s new makeshift crew.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, what do you think of how<strong>&nbsp;Star Trek: Picard</strong> portrays both its star and the new collection of characters on the show?
