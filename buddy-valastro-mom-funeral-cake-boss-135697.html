Outside the shop, two flower boards featured the messages “#1 Grandma” and “Mama Mary.” Another arrangement was created to emulate the Carlo’s Bakery entrance.</p><p>“Hoboken ❤️,” Buddy simply captioned the side-by-side photos. “So very sorry for the loss of your mother, she will be your [family’s] angel in heaven,” one of the reality star’s 2.4 million followers commented on the pic with another adding, “What a beautiful tribute!”</p><p>Carlo’s Bakery employee Ralph Attanasia III similarly took to social media on Thursday to pay tribute to Mary on the day of her funeral. “Today we said goodbye to a truly singular, vibrant woman, Mary Valastro. She always had a song on her lips and made sure we were taken care of,” <a href=#>he wrote on Twitter</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, the official Instagram account for Carlo’s announced all of the <a href=#>Valastro family’s bakeries would be closed</a> on June 27 “in observance of the mourning of the passing of Mary Valastro.”</p><p>“Thank you in advance for your understanding. Normal business activities will resume Wednesday, June 28, 2017,” the <a href=#>message concluded</a>.</p><p>Mary sadly passed away on the morning of Thursday, June 22 at age 69 after an eight-year battle with ALS. “It’s with an extremely heavy heart that I must share the news of my mother’s passing. She left for heaven this morning, surrounded by the family,” her son, Buddy, <a href=#>confirmed via Instagram at the time</a>.</p><p>“This is a difficult time for all of us and I do ask for your patience and respect while we let this sink in,” the 40-year-old TLC star continued. “Her battle with ALS has ended, she is no longer suffering and I hope she’s dancing to ‘I Will Survive’ with my dad right now.”</p><p>Our thoughts are with the Valastro family during this difficult time.</p><h2>More From Closer Weekly<br></h2><p><a href=#>Prince Charles Mourns the Death of His Godmother Lady Mountbatten</a></p><p><a href=#>Bindi Irwin Announces Late Dad Steve Irwin Will Receive a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — “This Means the World!”</a></p><p><a href=#>Jim Carrey Heading to Trial in Late Girlfriend Cathriona White’s Wrongful Death Lawsuit</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46brJ2cqWLDorjArKurp12ivK55xa6lnqqRoXqkrcqeZJuno6h6cn%2BUb3BwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
