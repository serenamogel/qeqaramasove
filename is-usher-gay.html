In this singer’s case, a lot of those pertain to his sexual orientation.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Usher is only one of the many, many celebrities who have become the subject of constant gay rumors over the years. Of course, speculation tends to latch onto some folks more than others — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Zakhar Perez</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Kaulitz</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jared Leto</a> are good examples — but at one point or another, most stars have to deal with it. It’s like a rite of passage, in a way.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>Naturally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accusing celebrities of queerbaiting</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pressuring them to come out</a> have become prominent issues in society, and people are steadily becoming more aware of the problems with such things. However, it’s difficult for some to hold back their curiosity, and truth be told, wondering doesn’t harm anyone if done with care and respect.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why do people think Usher is gay?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Usher (@usher)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Speculation about Usher’s sexuality is nothing new, and it tends to oscillate as time goes by. One of the situations that most contributed to the rumors took place in 2017, when two women and a man filed a lawsuit against Usher, claiming to have had their lives endangered by the singer, who allegedly exposed them to the herpes virus without their knowledge during an unprotected sexual encounter.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Other celebrities, such as Jenny McCarthy, have also publicly questioned Usher’s sexuality, which only fanned the flames. When asked if she found him attractive during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Huffington Post’s HuffPost Live</a> in 2013, the actress responded by questioning if he’s actually straight or possibly bisexual. She further claimed that she was unsure about the singer’s sexuality due to him being well-kept.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>Tameka Foster, Usher’s ex-wife, did something similar in 2011 when she made a since-deleted post on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X (then Twitter)</a>, affirming that gay men who act straight should be identifiable by bright wristbands. The unfortunate comment was taken as a hint about Usher’s sexuality, and to this day, folks with good memory still bring it when speculating. With this many instances in which Usher’s attractions are brought into question, it’s easy to understand why rumors persist.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-usher-s-sexuality data-injectable=false>What is Usher’s sexuality?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Usher (@usher)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Simply put, we don’t know what Usher’s sexuality is, as the singer has never openly put a label on it. Granted, he has been in public relationships with women in the past — Grace Miguel, Jenn Goicoechea, and Tameka Foster quickly come to mind — but that fact in itself isn’t enough to tell us what his sexual orientation is. Thus, it’s best not to assume anything.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>Romantic and sexual attractions are something personal, so it’s completely understandable why Usher has never addressed any rumors about the subject. If the singer ever feels the need to share this private detail with the world, he will do it when he feels comfortable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnUrJ%2Beql2crrp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
