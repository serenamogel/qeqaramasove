The defining moment of their youth and their shared future was a chance encounter with the attempted robbery of an armored truck. With the robbers and all but one of the guards dead, the teens stole $3 million, and the most violent of the quartet killed the only surviving witness. He was arrested and sent to prison. The other three went on with their lives.</p><p>Fifteen years later, Sonny (Tremaine "<a href=#>Trey Songz</a>" Neverson), the de facto leader of the old gang, has become a police detective with a fine record and a broken marriage to Megan (Tanee McCall) to show for it. Jake (<a href=#>Jack Kesy</a>), the guy who took the fall for his buddies, is being released from prison. Sonny goes to pick up his old friend, but in a power play that primarily sets up an additional number of people shooting during the climax, Jake has called his brothers to bring him home without telling Sonny.</p><p>Tensions ease when Jake calls Sonny and the other two friends (played by <a href=#>Hassan Johnson</a> and J.D. Williams)—who don't matter here, until they really don't matter—to split the stolen money. Sonny and Jake seem to be pals again, with Jake wanting to go with Sonny to a music recital for Megan's younger sister Darcy (<a href=#>China Anne McClain</a>). Along the way, the two stop at a corner store, where Jake viciously murders the employees and goes on the run.</p><p>The prologue and brief first act of <a href=#>Michael Finch</a>, <a href=#>Karl Gajdusek</a>, and Charles Murray's screenplay gives the impression that the screenwriters might have something to say about these characters, their relationship, and the conditions that have led them to this place. The introduction sets up a promising dichotomy between Sonny and Jake, as the reformed friend suggests that the recently incarcerated one might be able to turn around his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46bo6inlGKvs7vToZyrZWJlfnk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
