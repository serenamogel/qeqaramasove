Later, Carolla was unmasked as the Avocado after facing off with winner Snowstorm in a battle royale introduced by Drew Carey (in which both took turns singing the song “You’re So Vain,” by Carly Simon). Snowstorm moves on to next week’s episode.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For Bride, no one got it right. Robin Thicke thought it was Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg thought it was Vin Diesel. Nicole Scherzinger picked Sammy Hagar. Ken Jeong guessed Matthew McConaughey.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for Avocado, also no guessed correctly. Robin Thicke picked Tim Allen. Nicole Scherzinger thought it was Joe Rogan. Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg named Marc Maron. &nbsp;Ken Jeong said Dax Shepard.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m always up for experience and a challenge,” Carolla told Variety. “They give you all the help they can over there, and I’m certainly no singer. I don’t have a very good singing voice, but I do think they try to find that song that kind of captures your vibe or your energy… ultimately, at the end of the day to just go have fun out there like make it your own and then once once I got those marching orders, I’ve stopped trying to be a good singer and sort of make it my own.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Chris Jericho as Bride and Adam Corolla as Avocado join George Foreman as Venus Flytrap, George Clinton as Gopher, Joey Lawrence as the Walrus, Le’Veon Bell as the Milkshake, Kat Graham as Robo Girl, Jerry Springer as Beetle, Gloria Gaynor as Mermaid, Mario Cantone as Maise, Daymond John as the Fortune Teller, Barry Williams/Christopher Knight/Mike Lookinland as the Mummies, Montell Jordan as Panther, Jeff Dunham as Pi-Rat, Chris Kirkpatrick as the Hummingbird, Eric Idle as the Hedgehog and William Shatner as the Knight as the celebrities revealed in “The Masked Singer” in Season 8.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Multiple eliminations in one episode are the norm this time out, as “The Masked Singer” adopts a new “King or Queen of Masked Singer” format. This season, three or four costumed celebrities will perform each week, but only one will win and move on to compete against two or three more people the following week.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That will continue throughout the season, as after each round, three finalists will compete in the semi-finals. The Harp survived Round 1 and is the first to make it to the semi-finals, while Lambs won Round 2 and will also be in the semis.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The Masked Singer” enters Season 8 with costumes including “Bride,” “Avocado,” “Venus Fly Trap,” “Sir Bugaboo,” “Scarecrow,” “Hedgehog,” “Mummies.” Themed episodes include “Vegas Night,” “Comedy Roast,” “Hall of Fame,” “Muppets Night,” “Andrew Lloyd Webber Night,” “TV Themes,” “’90s Night,” “Thanksgiving” and “Fright Night.” Guests this season include Donny Osmond, Andrew Lloyd Webber, The Muppets, Will Arnett, Leslie Jordan, Joel McHale, Tori Spelling, Jon Lovitz, Jodie Sweetin, Carrot Top, Blue Man Group, Lance Bass, Danielle Fishel, Sheila E. and Drew Carey.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Season 8 contestants “boast a combined 32 Grammy nominations, 16 Emmy wins, 8 gold albums, 4 Golden Globe nominations, 42 books, 10 Teen Choice awards, and 5 stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.” &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Here were the contestants and their performances on night eight:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MS-S8_EP805-Show-MB_00306_f.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>Snowstorm (WINNER)</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Song</strong>: “Thank U, Next,” by Ariana Grande</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Weakness</strong>: Snow men</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue</strong>: Can’t sit down</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue delivered by Jon Lovitz</strong>: “She has shared the stage with A-list superstars like Rob Lowe, and non A-listers like Dr. Ken.” &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Package voiceover</strong>: “Hey y’all, let me tell you something funny. To do what I do, you’ve got to be cold blooded. So becoming Snowstorm actually makes sense for me. And while I can be a total blizzard when I want to be, I swear I am just the sweetest thing. I started working when I was 18 and it took a tight two years to see myself on the screen. Because being a woman, I had to snowplow my way into a male-dominated industry. Things haven’t always been pitch perfect, I’ve had some failures. But bombing wildly has made me fearless. So this song goes out to my favorite fearless lady, Nicole. Who has had more famous exes than Nick has had baby mamas.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Panel guesses</strong>: Kathryn Hahn, Heather Graham, Zooey Deschanel, Iliza Schlesinger, Aubrey Plaza, Whitney Cummings</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MS-S8_EP805-Show-MB_00162_f.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>The Bride (Chris Jericho)</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Song</strong>: “White Wedding,” by Billy Idol</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous Song</strong>: “Shut Up and Dance,” by Walk the Moon</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue Delivered by Jon Lovitz: </strong>“They have a movie career and they like to show off their chest, just like Jenny McCarthy. Minus the movie career.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Package voiceover</strong>: “Beating Gopher last week in the battle royale was killer. I know it’s not ladylike to showboat, but this queen just can’t help herself. Two new challengers are knocking on my kingdom’s door. But the claws are out and this queen is ready to conquer anyone who comes between the queen and my crown. Now I know you’re all dying to know who this blushing bride is, so here’s another juicy clue: 1) “Become a Hero Queen” 2) “Act Up” &nbsp;Ring any wedding bells? Speaking of royal weddings, this week’s opus goes out to Mrs. McCarthy Wahlberg, who wasn’t fooling anybody with that white wedding dress.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Panel guesses: </strong>Flea, Matthew McConaughey, David Arquette</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous panel guesses</strong>: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, David Coverdale, Carrot Top</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MS-S8_EP805-Show-MB_00473_f.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>Avocado (Adam Corolla)</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Song</strong>: “Hit the Road Jack,” by Ray Charles</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Strength</strong>: Keto friendly</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue: </strong>Dude’s dude</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue Delivered by Jon Lovitz:</strong> “For Avocado, he’s really into home renovation, but it’s not like he’s a Property Brother.

I used to be an average Joe, working in construction, real get your hands dirty kind of jobs. But I didn’t want to work outside forever. I wanted that air conditioned life. And I really wanted to make people laugh. So on a whim, I met a buddy who helped me trade in my tools for some sweet sweet AC. After some success I wanted to expand my reach, so I took a risk on a whole new venture. And it became a billion dollar industry. So what the heck am I doing here? Well, it’s comedy roast night, and I’m dedicating this diss track to the comedian who’s legally required to appear on every Fox show.
