In Seacrest’s own decades-long career he’s held lots of diverse positions, everything from a radio DJ, to a daily show co-host, with lots of things in between. To call Seacrest “experienced” is an understatement. Yet we wanted to know how, exactly, Seacrest got his start, and how his career trajectory led him to the point of accepting the coveted position he has today. Here’s what we found out.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Ryan Seacrest’s career began as early as his high school days when after winning an internship in his hometown of Atlanta, he was trained and even allowed to go on air at WSTR, a local radio station. At just age 14, his career had begun. College brought more of the same, as he continued with the station while pursuing a degree in journalism, and it was there that his natural talent for hosting really began to shine through.</p><p data-characters=698 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Apparently, radio was Seacrest’s first love, and he has continued to return to it throughout his career. In fact, in 2002 Seacrest told the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> LA Times </a>“Radio has been my first love since I was a little boy. Radio certainly laid the foundation for my comfort on television. Radio has become an extension of me. I’ve always wanted to do both radio and TV.” In fact, in 1995 Seacrest scored a prime DJ role on a popular Los Angeles radio station KYSR-FM. While he left the position for a gig in San Francisco, he did return in 1997 to cohost a show on the station with Lisa Foxx. Yet radio is not Seacrest’s only claim to fame, as we all know. So what were some of his other gigs?</p><h2 id=h-seacrest-s-game-show-era-1993-2002 data-injectable=false>Seacrest’s game show era, 1993-2002</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=720 data-current-count=1020 data-injectable=true>Seacrest’s television debut came in 1993 with his role as host of the show Radical Outdoor Challenge on ESPN. The series featured teens braving the elements in radical challenges in the great outdoors. They climbed through mud, carried sticks, and participated in races and a wide array of other random yet incredibly difficult challenges; think summer camp competition style. The show was even set at Camp Thunder in Georgia. Unfortunately, the role did not last very long, as the show was not as big of a hit as originally predicted. His next role was in 1995 as the host of Gladiators 2000, the kid’s version of American Gladiators, so a similar theme as ROC, but with higher stakes and harder challenges.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>In 1997, Seacrest once again found himself hosting a teen competition on the Y2k-themed show Click. In the show, teens answered questions about the internet (keep in mind it was a new thing back then), and they could win cash prizes if their internet savvy proved correct. The show was produced by Merv Griffin, who is also the producer of Jeopardy and, of course, Wheel of Fortune.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>American Idol-2002-current</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=759 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>After his run of game show hosting, Seacrest was in his prime to take on a co-hosting gig of one of the soon-to-be hottest shows on television. The instantly successful show featured everyday Americans with incredible talent who competed in a singing competition determined by celebrity judges. Many American Idol contestants went on to have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">very successful singing careers</a>, notably Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson, and more. The judges too were some well-known names, including Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson. While Seacrest initially began the role as a cohost with Brian Dunkelman, that pairing was short-lived as Dunkelman left after the first season, citing the treatment of the contestants as the reason for his quick departure. Yikes.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>Yet Seacrest remained and took on the hosting role solo. He has been hosting the show ever since, and continues to do so as it rounds its 22nd season.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>On Air With Ryan Seacrest– 2004-current</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by On Air with Ryan Seacrest (@onairwithryan)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>As we’ve discussed, while Seacrest shines in the TV spotlight, radio has his heart. His next big entertainment break came from his favorite platform. He landed his very own radio show titled On Air With Ryan Seacrest, which began in 2004 and is still going today. In fact, rumor has it he signed a contract with IHeartMedia to keep it going until 2025, at least. He also hosts the popular American Top 40 countdown, which counts down the hottest 40 songs on the radio. That is another gig he still has going today.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>New Years Rockin’ Eve-2005</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=896 data-injectable=true>Dick Clark is known for his reigning position ringing in the new year in Times Square during his New Year’s Rockin Eve special. Then in 2005, Seacrest got quite the treat when he was invited to come aboard as cohost. Seacrest was thrilled as he reportedly grew up watching the show as a family tradition. He continued hosting the show with Clark until 2012, when in a Christmas miracle, Clark passed the show all the way over to Seacrest. Seacrest was understandably thrilled, and while the show includes various guests over the years, Seacrest is still the main man of the yearly special.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>E!

Network to host (and produce) several of their shows and events, including E!’s Live From the Red Carpet, Keeping up With the Kardashians, and most of their spinoff shows, such as Life of Kylie, etc. Although eventually, the Kardashian clan would move off the E! Network to Hulu, Seacrest followed them as producer. Then after 14 years of hosting live red-carpet and other events, Seacrest finally bid E! Network adieu in pursuit of even more roles.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Live With Kelly and Ryan– 2017-2023</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=1143 data-current-count=1443 data-injectable=true>Another day, another show with Ryan Seacrest’s name on it! In 2017 Ryan got another show with a prime spot as co-host as he and Kelly Ripa got their own daytime show. The pair hosted things straight from the Big Apple, relocating Ryan to NYC. He spent six years with Ripa as they took on everything from cooking, to politics and so much in between. Yet after six years of making daytime magic and memories, Seacrest had to say farewell to Ripa. Seacrest revealed a desire to move back to LA, which would leave the show without a co-host. Luckily Ripa’s husband Mark stepped up to fill the role, and Ripa and Seacrest shared a tearful farewell on their final show in April of 2023. Once again to keep count, before leaving the show at one point Ryan is co-hosting Live With Kelly and Ryan, several shows on the E! Network, American Idol, plus his own radio shows. Oh and let us not forget New Year’s Rockin’ Eve every New Year. So — approximately five or six shows at any given time. He is definitely a busy guy. Also more importantly a very prepared and experienced guy, which is good because his next role is a big one!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wheel of Fortune- 2023-?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=887 data-current-count=1187 data-injectable=true>Wheel! Of! Fortune! Everyone knows the familiar intro to one of America’s most beloved television shows. Now Ryan Seacrest will be taking the place of the much-loved host Pat Sajak to lead one of the nation’s oldest shows into a whole new generation. In a post to his Instagram, Seacrest reveals he is “very humbled” to be stepping into Sajak’s shoes and even references his old game show Click, from the Y2K era. He says the new role is truly a “full circle moment” for him, as Merv Griffin created both shows. Game shows are what gave Seacrest his start, and are now where over two decades later, he has found his way again. Although while Seacrest may be thrilled, long-time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans of the show are hesitant. </a>Although truthfully after 40 years of Pat Sajak, any change in host is probably going to bring some discontent among long-time viewers.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Ryan Seacrest’s career has certainly been a successful one with everything from radio djing to game show hosting. Now it seems the crowning jewel of his career is also one that comes full circle for him. From one Merv Griffin show to another, we can’t think of a better way for Seacrest to round out his career, than with a victory lap to one of the arenas that gave him his start.
