When she was chosen for the show and asked to participate, she was utterly taken aback, realizing her dream had come true. Amanda described her background as a buttercream watercolor with flower biscuits. Amanda told SurreyLive that after hearing the good news, her skin would turn pink from exposure to cold water.</p><h2>Amanda’s Age in 2023</h2><p>Amanda, a baker based in London, will be 57 years old in 2023. Every year, she celebrates her birthday with her family and close friends. She enjoys swimming and traveling to exotic locations. Do you have any idea?</p><p>Amanda was born in 1965 in London, England, and was raised in a Roman Catholic family. She is of Greek-Cypriot descent, so she was influenced by the Greek and Middle Eastern baking cultures.</p><h2>Amanda’s Bake Off Partner – Is She Married?</h2><p>Amanda is married but has never spoken publicly about her husband or children. Her husband appears supportive and caring as he encourages her to compete in The Great British Bake Off.</p><p>Is there anything else to it? Amanda learned how to decorate cakes from her two adult daughters. Meanwhile, she sees her children as an aesthetic feminine. As a result, her fans wish her the best of luck in the ongoing baking competition.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Amanda</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Bake Off 2021</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYppmema5ustGopGaakaCybrvFn2RraGJmfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
