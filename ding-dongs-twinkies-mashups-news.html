Ever eat a Ding Dong and wish it was a biiiiiiiiiiiit more vanilla-y? Ever eat a Ding Dong and wonder if they are called that because they are vaguely shaped like doorbells? Well, if you have ever wondered about the first two things, you are in luck (as for the third one, I have no idea—scientists are unsure to this day). Now why are people who bought Twinkies and were disappointed by the lack of chocolate in luck? Because Hostess just released the biggest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">snack cake</a> crossover of the century: Ding Dong x Twinkies Mashups. No more shall you have to choose between chocolate or vanilla on your snack cake runs, because Hostess really took a page out of Old El Paso’s book and said “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">¿Porqué no los dos?</a>”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-parts-of-this-mashup-are-ding-dong-and-what-parts-are-twinkie-if-i-yell-avengers-assemble-before-i-eat-one-will-it-objectively-be-a-bigger-crossover-event-than-endgame-and-infinity-war-combined>So what parts of this mashup are Ding Dong and what parts are Twinkie? If I yell “Avengers, assemble!” before I eat one will it objectively be a bigger crossover event than Endgame and Infinity War combined?</h2><p>The answer to question number two is an absolute yes. No doubt about it. This is canon. As for question one, it would seem these will have the hockey puck-like shape and chocolate coating of a Ding Dong with the yellow cake and vanilla crème of a Twinkie inside. Sort of a Boston cream pie/chocolate éclair sort of situation. This new mashup will supposedly be very similar to Twinkies Chocodiles, which are chocolate-covered Twinkies that were around on the West Coast until the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">late ’90s</a>, disappeared, came back in 2014, and have always been somewhat difficult to find no matter where you are or what year it is. But that all ends now because this new mashup of Ding Dongs and Twinkies will be available nationwide at Walmart stores starting this month! Alas, if you are one of those people who has spent your life searching in vain for the elusive Chocodile (a Chocodile hunter, if you will), then I am happy to tell you that your search can likely come to an end this July. Happy hunting!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJyZo7RusM6nnqxlpKy2r7fInqpmpZGotba80malnq%2BjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
