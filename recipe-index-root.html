I always love cornbread, but lately, Iâ€™ve been especially smitten with this jalapeÃ±o version. Itâ€™s tender, moist, and a little crumbly in the way that good cornbread should be. In addition to adding jalapeÃ±os, I mix in scallions and shredded cheddar cheese, making this jalapeÃ±o cornbread spicy, sweet, and savory all at once. Even Jack, who doesnâ€™t typically like cornbread, goes nuts over this recipe. Heads up: youâ€™ll want to save room for a second piece.

I know I have! Soggy lettuce. Soggy bread. Zero flavor. Yeahâ€¦no thanks. But luckily for us, vegan sandwiches donâ€™t have to be like that. Sure, they arenâ€™t made with meat or cheese, but that doesnâ€™t mean they have to skimp on flavor. Try making vegan sandwiches with different sauces and spreads, roasted or pickled veggies, and/or fresh herbs, and youâ€™ll find that theyâ€™re just as tasty as their traditional counterparts. To get you started, Iâ€™m sharing 12 of my favorite vegan sandwich ideasâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Is anyone else trying to get in a new meal prep routine this fall? Jack and I took some time off last week for an end-of-summer trip to Michigan. It was so fun and relaxing, but when we got back, I realized just how busy the next few months are going to be. Thankfully, I have a full arsenal of healthy meal prep ideas to help us get through it. ðŸ™‚ In case youâ€™re also having a busy fall, Iâ€™m sharing over 60 of my healthy meal prep ideas today.

Theyâ€™re fresh and satisfying, filled with a crisp kale salad, creamy avocado, and hearty chickpeas. But the secret ingredient that makes them so flavorful is the dressing. Itâ€™s a sharp, savory honey-Dijon vinaigrette that I whizz together in the blender so that itâ€™s creamy and emulsified. When I assemble these sandwich wraps, I mash some of the dressing with the chickpeas, toss some with the veggies, and serve the restâ€¦</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>How pretty is this fresh fruit platter?! Itâ€™s a colorful combination of fruits, cheeses, spreads, and snacks that Iâ€™ve been absolutely loving lately. Iâ€™m sharing it today because it would be a fantastic last-minute appetizer for a Labor Day party or cookout, but honestly, itâ€™s a great easy dinner idea, too. On warm nights when Iâ€™m not in the mood to cook, I slice up some fresh fruit, grab a handful of herbs from the porch, and pile them onto a fruit and cheese platter like this one.

September already? How did that happen?! We might be nearing the end of the season, but I hope you still have a BBQ, cookout, or casual get-together left in store. In my book, at least, thereâ€™s not much that beats catching up with family or friends on a warm afternoon or evening. And if it just so happens that thereâ€™s a plate of summer appetizers nearby, well, thatâ€™s even better.

Ok, more like TAT pasta salad, but this recipe has some serious BLT flavors going on, so weâ€™re sticking with that. As you might have guessed, thereâ€™s no actual&nbsp;bacon here, just my trusty tempeh bacon plus sun-dried tomatoes for an extra savory kick. This BLT pasta salad recipe would be a great dish to pass at a Labor Day gathering this weekend, but itâ€™s also hearty enough to be a vegetarian main dish. Pack it up for a weekday lunch, or serve it for a light dinner.

Seriously! Iâ€™m in love with the creamy, tangy filling, the sweet and salty crust, and the jumble of fresh fruit on top. I tested it a number of times this summer to get the recipe just right, and each time, I looked forward to eating it. Its mix of juicy, creamy, crunchy, salty, tart, and sweet elements is just too good to beat. Another great thing about this fruit tart recipe is that it doesnâ€™t require any baking.

Has anyone else been super busy lately? Between writing and recipe testing, working on projects around the house, and squeezing in fun summer activities, I feel like weâ€™ve barely had a minute to rest, let alone do chores and errands like going to the grocery store. Donâ€™t get me wrong â€“ itâ€™s a good problem to have. I love being busy with work and getting outside to enjoy the warm weather. But when something comes along that makes humdrum, everyday tasks a little more convenient, Iâ€™m pretty darn happy about it.

I coat eggplant slices in a mixture of panko bread crumbs, almond flour, and Parmesan cheese and then air fry them to golden brown perfection.
