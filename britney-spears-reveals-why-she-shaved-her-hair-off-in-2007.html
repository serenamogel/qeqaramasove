I’d been looked up and down, had people telling me what they thought of my body, since I was a teenager,” she wrote.</p><p>“Shaving my head and acting out were my ways of pushing back,” the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Piece of Me” singer</a> continued.</p><p>A year after the experience, her father, Jamie Spears, took over authority of her finances, as well as her medical care.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The pop star was under a conservatorship until 2021. <span class=credit>Instagram / Britney Spears</span></figure><p>“I was made to understand that those days were now over,” Spears wrote about feeling controlled by those around her.</p><p>The mother of two added: “I had to grow my hair out and get back into shape. I had to go to bed early and take whatever medication they told me to take.”</p><p>In 2007, Spears went to Esther’s Haircutting Studio in Tarzana, California, and asked for her hair to be cut off. When owner Esther Tognozzi refused, Spears shaved off her own hair.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“Shaving my head and acting out were my ways of pushing back,” the “Piece of Me” singer said.</figure><p>Spears, who was undergoing a divorce from Kevin Federline at the time, used the salon’s razor and gave herself a buzzcut. The moment was captured by photographers who were camped outside the establishment.</p><p>The “Toxic” crooner scribbed: “I became a robot. But not just a robot — a sort of child-robot. I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself.”</p><p>Just days later, she was photographed attacking a photographer’s car with an umbrella.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Spears’ memoir “The Woman in Me” will be released Oct. 24. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>The following year, she was put on <a href=#>two involuntary psychiatric</a> holds, with Jamie becoming her legal guardian.</p><p>Over a decade after the hair-shaving incident, the “Crossroads” star’s <a href=#>conservatorship was finally dissolved</a> and came to an end in 2021.</p><p>“The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child,” Spears wrote. “I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98>“If they’d let me live my life, I know I would’ve followed my heart and come out of this the right way and worked it out,” she recalled in her memoir. “Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick.”</p><p>“The Woman in Me” hits stores Oct. 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmam9fl7%2BqwM2esGaroJqus7%2BMq5yvnZGhwG7Dx7JkrKCVYsCprdWem2aglad6qa3Iq2SonpZitq95kWlncGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
