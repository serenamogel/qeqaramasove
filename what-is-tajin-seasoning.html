It’s a potent mix of sweet, sour, and salty that just says “fun.” As with all popular drinks, variations of the classic Margarita abound. There’s the frozen version, of course, as well as a panoply of different flavors such as mango, raspberry, peach, and watermelon. You can also replace the salt on the rim with something else, such as shredded coconut (gross) or Tajin (amazing).&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps I’m trash, but Margaritas are how I first encountered Tajin and what I most associate with it. But if you’ve never been fortunate enough to enjoy a fruit, vegetable, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popcorn</a>, or Margarita brushed with Tajin, you might be wondering, what is Tajin? Let’s shake out some answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-tajin-seasoning><strong>What is Tajin seasoning?</strong></h2><p>Tajin seasoning is a spice blend that comes in a little bottle perfect for sprinkling on food or drink. Though often bright red in color, the blend of chili powder and dehydrated lime has a fairly mild heat. It was created by the Tajin company, founded in Mexico in 1985. Though the spice blend is their signature product, they also sell other adjacent products such as hot sauce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-in-tajin-seasoning><strong>What is in Tajin seasoning?</strong></h2><p>As the company’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> states, Tajin seasoning is, “A unique blend of 100% natural chili peppers, lime [and] sea salt that makes everything bueno, even more bueno.” That’s it—no added ingredients. That means Tajin is gluten-free, nut-free, vegan, and MSG-free.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-use-tajin-seasoning><strong>How to use Tajin seasoning?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>You just shake it onto anything your heart desires, especially things that could use a little kick of chili and lime flavor. It’s often used on citrus fruits like oranges as well as watermelon, mango, and pineapple. But it’s also good on veggies like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">corn on the cob</a>, avocado, and cucumbers. And, of course, you can sprinkle it onto chicken, into soups, or in tacos. And, as I mentioned, it’s a great replacement for salt on a Margarita.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-else-should-i-know-about-tajin-seasoning><strong>What else should I know about Tajin seasoning?</strong></h2><p>If you’re wondering why Tajin contains a disclaimer stating “this is not candy,” the website covers that: “TAJÍN® is so good that kids have been known to eat it straight from the bottle, as if it were candy. We want to make sure the product is consumed as intended: to season fruits, veggies, and your favorite foods.” I know this is the opposite of the intended effect, but this disclaimer kind of makes me want to eat a big spoonful of Tajin. Perhaps the Tajin challenge could replace the cinnamon challenge? I’m willing to try it!&nbsp;</p><p>Well, that’s the scoop on the sprinkle. Now that you’re a Tajin genius (Tajin-ius?) go out and try this seasoning on your favorite food to make it even better, or your least favorite food to make it tolerable.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmq5qimaN6tLHArKanoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
