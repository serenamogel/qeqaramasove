The daughter of Evelyn “Brandy” Ella and Lucius Fisher Foster III, Jodie is the youngest of four children. The future Academy Award winner began her acting career at the tender age of 3, with a role as the Coppertone Girl in a television commercial for the iconic suntan lotion brand.</p><img alt="paul hartman and jodie foster stand and look at each other with video equipment in the background, he wears a plaid shirt, vest and hat, she wears a nautical dress" title="Paul Hartman and Jodie Foster on 'Mayberry R.F.D'" width=2688 height=1996 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cast-members-paul-hartman-and-jodie-foster-appear-in-the-news-photo-1703103418.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Paul Hartman and Jodie Foster, seen here at age 7, were cast members on the CBS show Mayberry R.F.D.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A precocious and bright child from the start, Foster began talking at 9 months and had taught herself to read by the time she was 3 years old. Despite never having taken an acting class, she dove headlong into show business in 1968 with her first television show, Mayberry R.F.D. From there, she continued on to a busy career as a child actor, with Brandy always by her side, playing the dual role of manager and mother. “I still treasure her impact. She was very strong, self-educated but wasn’t pushy. She’d stay in the trailer and read magazines while I worked,” Jodie later recalled.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster’s first forays on the big screen came with roles in the Disney movies Napoleon and Samantha (1972) and One Little Indian (1973). All the while, Foster was studying at the private prep school Lycée Français de Los Angeles, juggling a challenging course load and becoming fluent in French.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 title="Breakthrough with Taxi Driver" data-anchor-id=breakthrough-with-taxi-driver class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Breakthrough with Taxi Driver</h2><img alt="jodie foster as iris and robert de niro as travis bickle in taxi driver sitting at a diner table" title='Jodie Foster and Robert De Niro starred in "Taxi Driver"' width=1024 height=696 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-actors-jodie-foster-and-robert-de-niro-sit-news-photo-1703018799.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Jodie Foster and Robert De Niro in a scene from the 1976 film Taxi Driver</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Foster’s breakout movie role came in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/martin-scorsese data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Scorsese" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Scorsese</a>’s 1976 crime thriller Taxi Driver, set in the gritty underbelly of 1970s-era New York.

Taxi Driver earned Foster her first Oscar nomination, though she ultimately lost to Beatrice Straight for Network. Still, the part established her as a teenage star and led to roles in popular movies like Freaky Friday (1976) and Foxes (1980), further cementing her place as one of Hollywood’s next darlings.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Nominees at the 49th Annual Academy Awards</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=22 title="Connection to Reagan Assassination Attempt" data-anchor-id=connection-to-reagan-assassination-attempt class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Connection to Reagan Assassination Attempt</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While everything seemed to be going right for Foster, she was uncomfortable with her growing fame. In search of anonymity and an ordinary collegiate experience, she enrolled in Yale University after graduating high school. The famous Ivy League rigor didn’t seem to intimidate the young actor, as she immediately enrolled in upper level French courses. “I chose Yale basically for writing and literature,” she says. “Of course, you can’t be sure—you get your first D and could decide to be a chemistry major.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But her dream of a quiet college life was dashed in 1981, when a disturbed man named <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/john-hinckley-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Hinckley Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Hinckley Jr.</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan-assassination data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="attempted to assassinate" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">attempted to assassinate</a> President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ronald Reagan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ronald Reagan</a> and said he did it in order to impress Foster.

When asked about the differences between acting and directing, she said: “Well, you have control, but you also have 175 people involved. Acting, for me, is exhausting. I’m always so energized by directing. It’s more intense to direct. I can pop in and express myself, then pop out again. It’s a huge passion for me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her feature-film directorial debut, Little Man Tate (1991), won widespread plaudits from critics.
