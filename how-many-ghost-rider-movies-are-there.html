And though some of the fans’ favorites are prominent in the Marvel Cinematic Universe adaptations, some others are seen as underappreciated. That can be considered the case with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Ghost Rider</strong></a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Loved by stars from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Norman Reedus</a> to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keanu Reeves</a>, Ghost Rider is a character whose official MCU debut is long overdue, despite already having a brief appearance in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and even his own movies.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>There are three main incarnations of the fiery motorcyclist: Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, and Robbie Reyes. All three of them have appeared in Marvel video games and animated series, including the X-Men animated series in the 1990s and, most recently, tactical RPG Midnight Suns. In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Blaze and Reyes were portrayed by Tom McComas and Gabriel Luna, respectively.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Luna was set to reprise his role as Robbie Reyes in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 Hulu series</a> about that incarnation of the character, to be called Marvel’s Ghost Rider. By the end of 2019, the streaming service had announced it wasn’t moving forward with the production. And now, with the upcoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Midnight Sons</a> and the constant teasing of his archenemy Mephisto, it seems like the perfect time to be excited about the character again.</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>Back in 2007, however, when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was barely starting, Sony Pictures was doing something else with a few characters, including Ghost Rider.</p><h2 id=h-ghost-rider-2007 data-injectable=false><strong>Ghost Rider</strong><strong> (2007)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil, Elektra), the movie stars Nicolas Cage, another fan of the character, as the Johnny Blaze incarnation of Ghost Rider, with Peter Fonda as his archenemy Mephisto. Development began in 2000, facing several changes along the way and eventually reaching theaters in 2007. But the result was panned by critics, even earning a Razzie nomination for Cage’s acting.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance</strong><strong> (2011)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>Despite being relatively successful at the box office, the first Ghost Rider movie was so badly received that many wondered why it had a sequel at all. It was still somewhat popular at first, but reviews were overwhelmingly negative — and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was nominated for two Razzies, doubling the nominations of its predecessor. Not even Nicolas Cage himself wanted in on a potential threequel, and the rights for the character returned to Marvel only two years later.</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>After these two titles, fans are eager to see what Marvel plans for the character, and if the studio is finally doing the Ghost Rider some justice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaKur8WMoJ%2Boq6Riv6qwxKtkpqemnrK0ecCrnGasmJq%2Fpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
