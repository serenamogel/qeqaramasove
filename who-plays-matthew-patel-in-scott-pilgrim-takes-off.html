The fresh animated series is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">offering a return to a story</a> that took on cult classic status more than a decade back, and its doing so in wonderful style. By retaining the same heart and eccentricity that made the first so popular — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not to mention the cast</a> — the remake is already a favorite among fans.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Almost every member of the original film’s cast returned for the joint revival/sequel to the 2010 live-action, which creates a wonderfully sentimental bridge between the two stories. The series largely covers the same events of the film, which was already adapting Bryan Lee O’Malley’s Scott Pilgrim comics, but its fresh style and matured cast make it a wholly unique viewing experience.</p><h2 id=h-matthew-patel-in-scott-pilgrim-takes-off data-injectable=false>Matthew Patel in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Scott_Pilgrim_Matthew_Patel.jpg><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>The plot contained in Scott Pilgrim is well known by now, but the new animated series will undoubtably serve as at least some viewers’ introduction to the story. The fresh series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like the comics and film before it</a>, tells the story of Scott Pilgrim, an early-20s bassist who falls for the mysterious Ramona Flowers. In order to win her heart, Scott must take on Ramona’s seven evil exes. The first of these exes is Matthew Patel, a character who —&nbsp;like Scott, Ramona, and the rest — is played by the same actor in the 2010 live-action and the 2023 animated series.</p><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=false>Patel is brought to life in both releases by <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Satya Bhabha</a></strong>, a British actor known for his work in television. He’s also graced a handful of movies, on top of his work on the Scott Pilgrim franchise, but viewers will also recognize him as Shivrang from New Girl, Jared from EastSiders, and Habib from Sense8. He brings a certain mature charm to every one of his roles, and fans are already swarming to praise his return as Patel in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasaNiuqLA06GcsGWglsGmuIyipWark6TBtXnPoqOgqpmierWtyp6qZqeWm3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
