Harris certainly enjoyed better chemistry with Craig than putative leading lady Bèrènice Marlohe, although that is partly due to a twist in the script. Harris' performance apparently impressed the producers and returning director <a href=#>Sam Mendes</a> enough to defy the final moments of "Skyfall," which promised a return to the MI6 of the early films, and send Moneypenny back into the field.<p>Because it just might be true, the Daily Mail item has Bond fans riled up (an easy thing to do, really). The immediate reaction was that that Bond has gone 50 years without a sidekick, and he doesn't need one now. The word "sidekick" has been incendiary, and I suspect Bamigboye's anonymous source chose it poorly.</p><p>Bond has never had a sidekick and is known for operating alone, but to call him a loner would be inaccurate. He has collaborated with CIA agent Felix Leiter and other MI6 operatives many times over the years. Citing Bond's independence isn't a strong enough argument against him reteaming with Moneypenny, providing she doesn't shoot him again.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5252aa064206c5f8b4000007/Naomie_Harris_as_Eve_-_Skyfall03.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p>I believe sending Moneypenny on assignment with Bond is a bad idea for other reasons. Even before the reboot, the films were focusing too much on internal MI6 politics. After he spent so much time in London in "Skyfall," I want to see Bond gallivanting around the world again without another MI6 agent in tow or worrying he might fail his next physical.<p>As I have thought about it, though, my objections to this rumor have less to do with Bond's integrity and more to do with Moneypenny's. After 25 years of getting Moneypenny wrong, the filmmakers, and Harris, finally got Moneypenny right again. Why tamper with that? She doesn't have to join Bond in the field to be an important player. I understand the cries to let Bond be Bond, sure, but I also say let Moneypenny be Moneypenny.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52RqcKzsdJomaKfXZi1orrGnmSfp6JiurC6xLKnnqaerg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
