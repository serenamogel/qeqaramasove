He is a rapper, songwriter, and producer known for his creative input, not only BTS’ music, but that of other K-pop groups and soloists as well. His interest in rap was ignited after he heard the Stony Skunk song “Reggae Muffin” and decided to become a rapper after listening to the music of Epik High. At 13, he was already writing lyrics and working at a recording studio, where he was composing, arranging, rapping, and performing music. He joined the hip-hop group D-Town in 2010 and — under the moniker Gloss — produced some of their best tracks. He chose the stage name Suga after he signed under his current company. The name was suggested because of his pale complexion, which he was told looked “sweet like sugar.” He took on the pseudonym Agust D when he released his mixtape in 2016 and now has over 100 registered songs credited to him by the Korea Music Copyright Association.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Jimin</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by JIMIN (@j.m)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=629 data-current-count=929 data-injectable=true>Park Jimin, popularly referred to as Jimin, is 26 years old.
