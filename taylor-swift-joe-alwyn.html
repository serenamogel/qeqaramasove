That’s an understatement. It wasn’t like, ‘It’s five o’clock, it’s time to try and write a song together.’ It came about from messing around on a piano and singing badly, then being overheard and being, like, ‘Let’s see what happens if we get to the end of it together.’”</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"><strong>Their breakup was unexpected</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">News of the couple’s breakup was confirmed in April 2023 while Swift was in the early months of her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/g45976562/taylor-swift-eras-tour/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="record-breaking Eras Tour" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">record-breaking Eras Tour</a>.
