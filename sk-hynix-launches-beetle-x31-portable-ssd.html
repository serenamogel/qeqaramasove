The drive promises to hit sequential transfer rates of up to 1,050 MB/sec when working with appropriate hosts. The drive is ultra compact and can store up to 1 TB of data, which is quite a bit higher than typical USB flash drives.</p><p>The SK Hynix Beetle X31 uses the company's 128-layer 3D NAND memory and boasts sequential read and write speeds of up to 1,050 MB/sec and 1,000 MB/sec, respectively. Meanwhile, the company promises that the drive can maintain speed of 'over 900 MB/s' though SK Hynix does not disclose the size of its SLC cache.</p><p>From performance standpoint, the drive is slower than high-end direct attached storage devices with a Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4 interface. Yet, it is reasonable to assume that it will cost significantly less than such DAS devices.</p><p>The manufacturer will offer its Beetle X31 in 512 GB and 1 TB versions, which is larger compared to typical inexpensive USB drives.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/18932/Sk-hynix_Beetle_01-1024x686_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>SK Hynix claims that the Beetle X31 is compatible with PCs, Macs, tablets, game consoles, and Android-based smartphones. The X31 drive features a USB Type-C interface and comes standard with two USB cables (USB C-to-C and C-to-A) and a bumper case.</p><p>The Beetle X31 measures 74 x 46 x 14.8 mm (which makes it a bit larger compared to USB flash drives) and weighs 53 grams. The drive comes in a sleek aluminum chassis.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/18932/SK-hynix_Beetle_03-1_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>"From the onset, the X31 was designed to be incredibly light and ultra-compact," said Chan-dong Park, head of NAND marketing at SK Hynix. "It also shares key component materials with the Gold P31, which features optimal power consumption. So, the X31 was a continuation of the P31â€™s design with added concepts that are unique to portable SSDs. A lot of effort was spent on enhancing the exterior elements of the product including its color and smooth texture to improve the user experience."</p><p>The Beetle X31 is already available in South Korea, it will be released in North America, Europe, and Asia shortly.</p><p><strong>UPDATE 6/29</strong>: The Beetle X31 drives are now available from Amazon: <a href=#>the 512 GB version is priced at $71.06, whereas the 1 TB model costs $92.69</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH55hZJrZqyjXZ3Gr7XXZqOarZ6Ytaa%2FjJucnqycmnq5f5Bmp6iqpJavrbGMrKqd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
