If someone as busy as White can occupy his time outside of work, so can you!</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>With a second season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Bear</strong></a> officially out and streaming (via Hulu), I thought it would be nice to revisit a 2016 piece by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview Magazine</a> that sat down with Jeremy Allen White long before he was chefin’ it up for the masses.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/i5U-w1yL4r0</figure><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>In the interview — White discusses his time on Shameless, upcoming projects (that have all since been made), and the first movie he ever fell in love with. Spoiler, it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lion King</a>.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Along with all that info, Jeremy decided to end his talk with an anecdote about a hidden talent of his. Dance. I guess being a fantastic actor wasn’t enough. He had to go and be a good dancer? Leave some talent for the rest of us, J-bone!</p><p>“It’s not really hidden, but I love to dance. I trained as a dancer when I was young—jazz, ballet, tap. Going out dancing with friends is my favorite thing to do. I break out all my old moves. All my friends make fun of me because I have a very specific dance I do when the tempo changes. I guess it would be described as a, like, a weird sashay-tap thing. But if I could dance forever, that would be great.”</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>The idea that anyone would make fun of Jeremy Allen White for doing something he loves is absolutely insane. They’re jealous, that’s all. He’s got sweet moves, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned in my 26 years on our little blue planet — it’s that plenty of folks out there can’t dance. Myself included.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Still, we all have that one thing we could do forever, right? Mine is snow skiing. What’s yours? Think about it hard enough, and I’ll use my super secret writer powers to read your mind… Ah-ha, something’s coming through. You like to birdwatch? Right on.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>Whatever the passion, The Bear is certainly a show worth loving — especially its sophomore season. Opening to rave reviews, there’s nothing quite like the adventures of White’s culinary Chicagoan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurbiMprBmnqKesq%2Bw0makmqOVYrO2uoyonWallWK3pr7EprBmmZyhsq951qGgrZ1dp7K3scClqmagmah6qbXDnZynZaSWuaa602g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
