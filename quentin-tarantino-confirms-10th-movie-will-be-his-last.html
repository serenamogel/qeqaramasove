Photo / Jason Oxenham</p><p>Director Quentin Tarantino confirmed in a new interview that his tenth and next movie will be his last.</p><p>The <i>Pulp Fiction</i> film-maker appeared on <i>Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace</i> to promote his new book <i>Cinema Speculation</i>.</p><p>During the interview, the 59-year-old explained why it is time to retire from directing.</p><p>“I’ve been doing it for 30 years, and it’s time to wrap up the show. I’ve done it, I’ve given my whole life to it. I didn’t start a family until late in life,” the Oscar-winner said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“I’ve always kind of equated if you’re doing movies on the level that I’ve been doing. Actually, the level I’ve been allowed to do. I equate it to mountain climbing, and so this movie is my Mount Everest, and this movie is Kilimanjaro, and this movie is Fuji.</p><p>“And I’ve spent all that time on the mountain and I’m an entertainer. I want to leave you wanting more.”</p><p>The <i>Kill Bill</i> director added he was not in a “giant hurry” to make his last film and has no idea what it will be about.</p><p>“I’m also not in a giant hurry to make my last movie either,” he said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“So I’ve got my book, I’m doing a few other things and then I’ll figure out what the next movie will be.”</p><p>Tarantino has famously said he’ll make 10 films before retiring at the top of his game.</p><p>The auteur told <i>GQ Australia</i> in 2019 that he’s at the “end of the road” of making movies.</p><p>“I think when it comes to theatrical movies, I’ve come to the end of the road,” he said.</p><p>“I see myself writing books and starting to write theatre, so I’ll still be creative. I just think I’ve given all I have to give to movies.”</p><p>Tarantino has been living a low-key life in Israel with his wife Daniella Pick, 39, and their children son Leo, 2, and 4-month-old daughter Adriana.</p><p>Back in 2019, the award-winning screenwriter told <i>Popcorn with Peter Travers</i> about his hopes for his future.</p><p>“I kind of feel this is the time for the third act [of my life] to just lean a little bit more into the literary, which would be good as a new father, as a new husband,” he reflected at the time.</p><p>“I’m not just grabbing my family and yanking them to Germany or Sri Lanka or wherever the next story takes place.</p><p>“I can be a little bit more of a homebody, and become a little bit more of a man of letters [...] I do feel that directing is a young man’s game.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“I do feel that cinema is changing, and I’m a little bit part of the old guard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2BtrHNraCnZaSWv6K606KlqGWTpLuntdGmqmZpYKm1brnOr6CeZaeeua15wZ5koaGjYrmiv9NogG9ugXyOlX%2B3f31wfnR4jnijqHptem14iZJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
